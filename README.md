# Crust of Rust practice problems

I am using this repo to store the code I write while following the Crust of Rust series, hands down some of the best Rust content I've found. Highly recommend checking out the [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa)

Also, Jon Gjengset's "Rust for rustaceans" book is very valuable!
